# These lines specify your backend protocol and your publication branch. Git Gateway is an open source API that acts as
# a proxy between authenticated users of your site and your site repo. If you leave out the branch declaration, it will
# default to master.

# By default, saving a post in the CMS interface will push a commit directly to the publication branch specified in
# backend. However, you also have the option to enable the Editorial Workflow, which adds an interface for drafting,
# reviewing, and approving posts.
publish_mode: editorial_workflow

# Netlify CMS allows users to upload images directly within the editor.  The media_folder specifies where these uploads
# should be saved.  Note that the media_folder file path is relative to the project root.  Since Gatsby stores static
# files in [project root]/static, our media_folder should be inside that directory.
media_folder: "static/img/uploads"

# While media_folder specifies where uploaded files will be saved in the repo, public_folder indicates where they can be
# found in the published site. This path is used in image src attributes and is relative to the file where itâ€™s called.
# For this reason, we usually start the path at the site root, using the opening /.  If public_folder is not set,
# Netlify CMS will default to the same value as media_folder, adding an opening / if one is not included.
public_folder: "/img/uploads"

# Collections define the structure for the different content types on your static site. Since every site is different,
# the collections settings will be very different from one site to the next.
